### Original Source Code

### Modified to make it compiles on osx 10.9.2

### The original README

```
******* README file for ruby-pwa package *******

There are only a few items that are new to the ruby-pwa package in 
revision 17.  They are as follows:

1) ALL .so files are now built from the pwa/src directory.

2) Machine-specific versions of these shared objects are build and placed
in the pwa/lib/(OS_NAME)/ directories.

3) In order for this build scheme to work properly, the onvironment variable 
OS_NAME needs to be set by a user's .cshrc or likewise.  You will notice that
the pwa/lib/ directory contains the LinuxRHEL5 and Linux64RHEL5 directories.  
These are merely examples.

Enjoy the new code!
